# 🖼️ Polysafe

**Polysafe** is a playful, powerful Rust tool for hiding your seed phrase inside a JPG image. Your photo stays perfectly viewable, but if you rename it to `.txt`, your secret seed phrase magically appears at the end—easy to recover, nearly invisible to prying eyes.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. Run the program.
2. Enter the path to your favorite JPG file.
3. Enter the path to your TXT file with your seed phrase.
4. Polysafe creates a new `polyglot.jpg` in your current directory.

Open `polyglot.jpg` in any image viewer to enjoy your picture.  
Rename it to `polyglot.txt` and open with a text editor—your seed phrase is waiting for you at the end!
